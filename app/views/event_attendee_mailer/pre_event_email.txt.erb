<%= @profile.name %> is attending <%= event.name %>!
===============================================

The event is <%= date_range(@event) %>.

<% if @friends_attending.none? %>
  None of your friends have said they're attending. :(
  I guess it's time to make some new ones!
  Does the event have a Slack or Discord? Try introducing yourself over there!
  Make sure to share your "MAD" profile, so you can meet up another day with your new friends!
  Good luck!
<% else %>
  Several of your friend are also attending! 
  You could reach out and see if they want to get dinner or lunch together while you're there.
